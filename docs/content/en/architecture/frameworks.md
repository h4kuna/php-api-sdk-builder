If the Framework supports **Service providers**, it will automatically tell the framework container
to resolve `SDKContainerFactoryContract` to correct factory implementation.

| Framework                      | Container class           | Framework resolves contract |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| [Laravel](https://laravel.com) | `LaravelContainerFactory` | ðŸ†˜                          |                               

> PR for more frameworks are welcomed

You are advised to inject `SDKContainerFactoryContract` or desired container factory implementation when
constructing `ApiFactory`
