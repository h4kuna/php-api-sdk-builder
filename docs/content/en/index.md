## Why to use?

- If you want to consume external API without losing type strict code (Data transfer objects instead of array keys).
- If you work with multiple APIs and want to use the same conventions.
- If you want to provide type strict way to build request parameters.
- If you want to save time building HTTP/s request.

## Features

- 🛠 Dependency injection using your favorite framework (Laravel, _PR for more_)
- ✅ Uses PSR packages you already use for HTTP/S communication
- 🏆 Forcing type strict implementation for input (endpoint options) and output (**Response**)
- 🎗 Encouraging **Data transfer objects**
- 🎭 Re-usable and configurable headers using objects

## Installation

```bash
composer require wrkflow/php-api-sdk-builder
