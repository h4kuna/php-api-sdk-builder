### Build unified APIs with dependency injection and strict code in mind.

```bash
composer require wrkflow/php-api-sdk-builder
```

> This package is still in its early stages. But the main concepts will probably remain same.

This package helps you build PHP clients for external APIs with dependency injection and type strict code in mind.

## Why to use?

- If you want to consume external API without losing type strict code (Data transfer objects instead of array keys).
- If you work with multiple APIs and want to use the same conventions.
- If you want to provide type strict way to build request parameters.
- If you want to save time building HTTP/s request.
